    name: 'Queen Mine Tour',
    description: `
      As Bisbee's mines were coming to an end in the mid-1970s, a group led by then-Mayor Chuck Eads conceived of the perfect transition to a tourism-based economy: the Queen Mine Tour.

      Build in one of the old mines near downtown, the Queen takes visitors deep into the mountain (on the same train miners once rode to work) to see how copper needed to electrify America was won from the hard rock. The tour guides -- former underground miners themselves -- take you through the mining process, from start to finish, and regale you with personal tales of the noble profession.
    
      The Queen Mine Tour is one of the oldest in the nation, and certainly among the highest-rated, mixing history with adventure and lore. You'll wear the garb of the old miners and have a chance to see what true darkness means. You understand the tools that brought miners the sobrique "men or iron" and you'll visit the various work areas in your 75-minute visit underground.
      The Queen Mine Tour runs several times every day. [Click here] (http://queenminetour.com) to get more details. To make reservations, call (520) 432-2071.

      No visit to Arizona is complete with a visit to what is arguable one of the finest small museums in the nation: the Bisbee Mining & Historical Museum. The premiere exhibit, created in affiliation with the Smithsonian, showcases many of the finest mineral specimens you'll see anywhere. Because of the fantastically diverse and extensive nature of the Bisbee orebodies, the district offers more than 330 species of minerals, ranging from mind-blowing azurites and malachites to beautiful stalactities and stalagmites formed deep in the earth.

      The Smithsonian-built exhibit also tells the elaborate story of mining through the eras of Bisbee's activity, both underground and openpit. Another exhibit, created with the assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities, goes into great detail about the origins of Bisbee and its diverse population. It shows how the wealth of copper, gold, silver and more developed a powerful economy and contributed to a dynamic history.
      
      The Museum is open every day from 10-4. For details, [click here](http://bisbeemuseum.org). For more information, call (520) 432-7071.

      The easy-to-walk business district of Bisbee is just a small part of the expansive historic district that was once home to some 14,000 residents (compared with about 1,800 today.) And the streets twisting up the mountainsides are . . . well . . . difficult to navigate, to say the least. That's why so many visitors rely on Lavender Jeep Tours to see "all of Bisbee." Not only do you get to "see" it all, you get the exciting story of Bisbee history, culture and more from guides who are either natives or long-term residents.

      You also can choose to see other parts of Bisbee, including Lowell, Warren (with the mansions, ballpark and more), or you can go to the border (not across, though) or up in the mountains outside the city. Or you can learn about the life and works of mystery writer [J. A. Jance] (http://www.jajance.com/jajance.com/works.html), who grew up in Bisbee. Or learn about the mining heritage of the entire district.
      
      Bisbee is eminently photogenic and Lavender Jeep Tours will get you to some of the best points for photography, whether you're interested in panoramas or selfies!
